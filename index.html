                 <p>My name is Marcus, and I'm currently learning how to be a Full Stack Developer.
                    How about we start from the beginning.

                <h1>The Beginning</h1>
                <strong><small><i>As A Child</i></small></strong>
                <p>My story starts in Hoffman Estates Illinois. My family has deep roots in Chicago and at that time we were more in the west suburbs of Oak Park.
                   We eventually left from out west and went to the south side. My parents divorced when I was still a baby, so it was just me and my mom.
                   As an only child on my mom's side, I learned to entertain myself and be self content at a young age. 
                   One day my mom surprised me with a computer and it was all she wrote from there.

            <p>So now I'm officially chasing the dream of being a <i>Dev</i> and determined to learn the ends and outs.
               I'll continue to update my story as lived. Be sure to check back for more!</p>
